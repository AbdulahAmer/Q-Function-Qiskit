# Q-Function Qiskit 
Solving problems in quantum computing using the QISKIT framework 

Here is an impovement on a function that prints out the Wavefunction of a quantum circuit in Dirac notation and cuts out all the zero entries
from a huge matrix. This makes it much easier to read the state of a quantum circuit of many more qubits than just two or three. 
As well, it adresses the problem of Qiskit labeling qubits backwards, the least significant qubit being the last qubit. This has helped me 
to work with Qiskit and build up to more complicated circuits as well check my work by hand on paper.
